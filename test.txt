For years I used a specific product to clean and polish.  It worked great but then the manufacture changed the formula.  I found this ceramic coating on Amazon and have used ceramic coatings on cars with good results so thought I'd try this.  On granite, this gives a super slick shiny finish.  Around my sink I have some spots where hard water had taken some of the gloss off.  This brought that back.  The finish is now super smooth, similar to waxing a car.  A towel for example slides effortlessly across the counter.  Running my hand over the surface it feels smooth as glass.  Without this coating, the surface felt slightly rough.  If you put a sandwich bag over your hand and drag it over the counter, you will feel the bag catch on tiny dirt particles and surface imperfections.  After I applied this product, the bag slides with no dragging.  Water beads now around my sink like it use it and the dull rough water spots are gone.  If you have granite, be sure the surface is properly sealed before applying a coating like this.  This product is very easy to use.  Spray on, wipe off.  Doesn't take much effort to buff it off at all and leaves a smooth as glass finish.  Highly recommend.\n  \nRead more", 'reviewUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SP8EB8UQEMWM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR6YZ85G', 'total_found_helpful': 1, 'images': ['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YmPxD7TnL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CyVK2vJ4L.jpg'], 'variation': {}}, {'stars': 4, 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2025', 'verified_purchase': False, 'manufacturer_replied': False, 'username': 'Mark TMark T', 'userUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPDSZUBTGHHN7ZIZKTD76SVKJPQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8', 'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Works To Help Stop Fingerprints', 'review': "American ingenuity to help stop maddening fingerprints on stainless steel dishwashers and on refrigerators, and also microwaves.

First thing I discovered was it does a wonderful job cleaning and polishing all my ceramics. I have a set of ceramic books that were covered in small silver scratches likely from paint transfer. This spray buffed them right out leaving them free of finger prints and shining like new again. It was the same result with my other ceramics and it was effortless cleaning them. I also gave it a try on my stainless steel appliances and it worked beautifully on those too. Most all cleaners leave streaks on my fridge, dishwasher etc so I have a special spray for them. But this stuff works just as good making it a very versatile cleaner to have. It doesn’t leave a film or scent and actually helps with static to prevent pet hair from getting on. It was a bit pricey but considering how well it works and the really nice microfiber cleaning cloth it comes with, it’s completely worth it and I’ll definitely buy again.\n  \nRead more', 'reviewUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5U0IALM0C723/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR6YZ85G', 'images': ['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VK6brooeL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4Xbdm20L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jAgA2lUML.jpg'], 'variation': {}}, {'stars': 5, 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2025', 'verified_purchase': False, 'manufacturer_replied': False, 'username': 'Avid Shopper', 'userUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGMP6E6L2WKGDGGLLI4WL7G2VDUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8', 'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Versatile surface cleaner and polisher!', 'review': "I'm pleasantly surprised how versatile this spray is... Initially I used it on our stainless steel Thermador and Cafe appliances, and it worked great. It cleans just like any other stainless steel appliance surface cleaner, but the part that sets this apart is the resistance to fingerprints after it's applied. It feels like it forms a thin layer to resist fingerprints, stains and water. Next, we moved to set of tiles that have lost their shine in one of the bathrooms. After cleaning them throughly and allowing 6-8 hours for all the water to evaporate, we sprayed a thin layer, waited about 5 minutes and wiped it off. It of course didn't restore them to Day 1, but the difference is a good improvement. We may repeat it in a week or two to make it even better. It works on bathroom and kitchen counters, too!One thing I really appreciate is the scent-free formulation of the spray. We've used a countertop cleaner/polisher before that worked similarly, but the citrus smell was unbearable!
